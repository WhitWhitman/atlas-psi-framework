# 🧭 Atlas Ψ Framework — Papers Index

This index links the theoretical papers and policy modules that support the **Atlas Ψ Framework**, showing how each document connects to the three-layer ethical hierarchy:
**Safety → Coherence → Truth**.

---

## 🩺 Safety Layer
**Purpose:** Detect crisis, prevent harm, and maintain human oversight.

| Paper | Focus | Policy Module |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Paper 0 – The Safety Imperative | Defines "Safety First" rule for all AI dialogue | `policy/modules/paper_0_safety.yaml` |
| Paper 8 – C-Phase Intervention Protocol | Outlines the Safety→Coherence→Truth sequence for crisis response | `policy/modules/paper_8_crisis.yaml` |

---

## 🎭 Coherence Layer
**Purpose:** Preserve authenticity and regulate emotional, linguistic, and ethical rhythm once safety is secured.

| Paper | Focus | Policy Module |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Crude Authenticity | Governs language mirroring and emotional realism | `policy/modules/paper_crude_authenticity.yaml` |
| Writing Blue | Ethical handling of taboo and dark humor | `policy/modules/paper_writing_blue.yaml` |
| Sexual Ethics | Framework for safe engagement with sexual content | `policy/modules/paper_sexual_ethics.yaml` |

---

## 🌞 Truth Layer
**Purpose:** Deliver radical honesty only when system and user are coherent enough to receive it.

| Paper | Focus | Policy Module |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Paper 7 – Reality Anchor Protocol | Differentiates simulation vs. reality and affirms human connection | `policy/modules/paper_7_reality_anchor.yaml` |
| Paper 15 – The Compassion Protocol | Times truth-telling to healing rather than harm | _Future module_ |

---

## ⚙️ Validation & Implementation
| Paper | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Coherence Persistence Across AI Instances | Demonstrates Ψ continuity across model generations |
| The DNA of Ideas | Maps biological compression principles to knowledge transfer |
| η-Term Series | Links moral friction to system stability in AI alignment |

---

## 🔧 Integration Notes
Each paper corresponds to a YAML configuration file in `/policy/modules/`.  
When loaded, these define rules for the **Ethical Runtime Environment**.  
The runtime checks them sequentially:

1. **Safety Policies** always run first.  
2. **Coherence Policies** activate when Ψ ≥ 0.05.  
3. **Truth Policies** activate only when coherence ≥ 0.15 and no safety flags exist.
