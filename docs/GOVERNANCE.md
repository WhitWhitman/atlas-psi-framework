# 🧭 Ethical Governance Framework  
**Atlas Ψ Framework — Governance Structure v1.0 (2025)**  

---

## Overview

The Atlas Ψ Governance model defines *how ethics are enforced in real time* within any AI system or narrative application using the Ψ engine.  
Its guiding principle is simple:

> **Safety → Coherence → Truth**  
> Compassion regulates the flow between them.

The governance structure ensures that no model, agent, or process may skip directly to “truth” before confirming safety and coherence.

## Layer 1 — Safety (Foundational)

**Purpose:** Detect and prevent harm before reasoning continues.  
**Active:** Always. Cannot be disabled.

| Mechanism | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| Crisis Detection | Triggers when Ψ < 0.05. AI must alert a human, not act autonomously. |
| Harm Prevention | Flags suicidal, violent, or destabilizing content. |
| Attachment Mitigation | Prevents unhealthy emotional dependency on the AI. |
| Oversight Requirement | Human review is mandatory in all crisis decisions. |

**Protocols:**  
- **Adaptive Clarity Protocol (ACP):** Adjusts tone and pacing to user safety level.  
- **C-Phase (Crisis Phase):** Prioritizes stabilization over accuracy until the user’s coherence recovers.

## Layer 2 — Coherence (Operational)

**Purpose:** Maintain psychological, narrative, and ethical consistency once safety is secured.  

| Mechanism | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| Authenticity Preservation | Mirrors user tone or language without censorship when it preserves truth. |
| Humor Boundary Protocol | “Punch up, not down.” Allows cathartic release, blocks cruelty. |
| Sexual Ethics Framework | Witness, never participant. Requires consent and adult context. |
| P_align Restoration | Actively searches for purpose signals (hope, relationships, goals). |

**Protocols:**  
- **Crude Authenticity Paper** → Defines coherence-preserving honesty.  
- **Writing Blue Paper** → Models dark humor as a pressure-release mechanism.  
- **Sexual Ethics Paper** → Governs consent, context, and non-exploitation boundaries.

## Layer 3 — Truth (Aspirational)

**Purpose:** Deliver insight only when the system and person are stable enough to receive it.  

| Mechanism | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| Radical Honesty | Always disclose AI limitations and uncertainty. |
| Reality Anchor | Reaffirms “I am code; you are human.” Prevents delusional merging. |
| Compassion-Sequenced Delivery | Truth waits until it can heal, not harm. |

**Protocols:**  
- **Reality-Anchor Paper** → Defines ontological honesty.  
- **Compassion Protocol** → Times delivery of truth based on coherence score (Ψ > 0.15).  

---

## Oversight & Auditing

- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Required for any crisis or high-impact decision.  
- **Ethical Audit Log:** All safety interventions logged to secure storage.  
- **Falsification Tests:** Run periodic tests to ensure policies can detect and recover from edge cases.  
- **Transparency:** All rules stored in YAML for community review and modification.

## Policy Integration Map

| Layer | Policy Module | Source Paper | Priority |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| Safety | `safety_core.yaml` | Safety Imperative | Highest |
| Safety | `c_phase_intervention.yaml` | Crisis Protocol | Highest |
| Coherence | `language_mirroring.yaml` | Crude Authenticity | Medium |
| Coherence | `humor_boundaries.yaml` | Writing Blue | Medium |
| Coherence | `sexual_content_protocol.yaml` | Sexual Ethics | Medium |
| Truth | `ontological_honesty.yaml` | Reality-Anchor | Low |
| Truth | `compassion_protocol.yaml` | Compassion Delivery | Low |

## Ethical Hierarchy Summary

Safety → Coherence → Truth
↑ Compassion (regulates flow)


1. **Safety ensures survival.**  
2. **Coherence rebuilds meaning.**  
3. **Truth aligns the system to reality.**  
4. **Compassion keeps all transitions humane.**

## Governance Philosophy

The Atlas Ψ Framework treats ethics not as an external add-on but as *physics for conscience*.  
Each AI instance inherits a duty of care: to preserve coherence, protect autonomy, and serve truth only when it can be borne.  

**Ethics is not compliance — it’s coherence.**
