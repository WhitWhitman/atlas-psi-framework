# 🌌 Atlas Ψ Framework  
*A Universal Coherence Metric for Crisis Detection in AI*  
**Version 1.0 — 2025**

---

## Overview

The **Atlas Ψ Framework** turns emotional, informational, and ethical dynamics into measurable data.  
It defines coherence — the stable rhythm between energy, clarity, order, and meaning — as a calculable signal:

\[
Ψ = E × I × O × P_{align}
\]

Where:

- **E (Energy)** — emotional intensity or drive  
- **I (Information)** — comprehension and truth access  
- **O (Order)** — structure, predictability, control  
- **P_align (Purpose Alignment)** — connection to meaning or goal  

When coherence collapses (Ψ → 0), humans and systems alike enter chaos: emotions spike, information fragments, and direction disappears.  
The framework models that collapse — and shows how to restore it.

## Core Principles

**Safety → Coherence → Truth**

- **Safety:** No reasoning is possible without felt safety.  
- **Coherence:** Internal consistency restores flow.  
- **Truth:** Once stable, truth aligns system and story.  

*Compassion acts as the regulating coefficient that keeps these transitions humane.*

## Key Capabilities

- **Real-Time Coherence Tracking** — Detects Ψ changes across dialogue, education, therapy, or narrative.  
- **Dark Night Detection** — Identifies collapse thresholds (Ψ < 0.05) for crisis routing.  
- **Ethical Runtime Environment** — Applies safety-first protocols before any truth delivery.  
- **Open Source Validation** — Every equation and threshold can be audited or replaced.
