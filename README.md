# 🌌 Atlas Ψ Framework  
*A Universal Coherence Metric for Crisis Detection in AI*  
Version 1.0 — 2025

---

## Overview

The **Atlas Ψ Framework** is an open-source architecture that allows any AI or narrative system to measure, visualize, and stabilize **coherence** — the energy of meaning that holds complex systems together.

At its core, it defines:

\[
Ψ = E × I × O × P_{align}
\]

Where:
- **E** = Emotional Energy (motivation, affect)
- **I** = Information Clarity (understanding, knowledge access)
- **O** = Order (structure, stability, control)
- **P_align** = Purpose Alignment (direction, meaning, “why it matters”)

When coherence (Ψ) collapses — whether in a story, a conversation, or a human crisis — the same pattern appears: emotion spikes, information fragments, and purpose vanishes.  
This framework detects that pattern in real time.

## Why It Matters

- **For AI Safety:**  
  AI systems can now *detect human distress states* (Ψ < 0.05) without making autonomous clinical judgments.
- **For Narrative Design:**  
  Writers and filmmakers can visualize emotional rhythm and collapse points in scripts.
- **For Education & Therapy:**  
  It models how purpose alignment stabilizes cognition — a bridge between narrative structure and mental health.

## The Three-Layer Ethical Hierarchy

| Layer | Function | When Active | Key Rule |
|-------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Safety** | Crisis detection & harm prevention | Always | Human must decide in all emergencies |
| **Coherence** | Maintain authenticity, humor, sexuality safely | When system stable | “Punch up, not down” |
| **Truth** | Deliver radical honesty & meaning | When coherent enough | “Truth waits until it can heal” |

All dialogue flows **Safety → Coherence → Truth**.  
A model may never skip ahead.
